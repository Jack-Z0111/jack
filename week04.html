	<h1>Response to ImageNet</h1>
	<p> <img src="Patrick-Henry.png" alt=""> </p>
	<p> I found that I didn't save the result from ImageNet BUT I did remember it recognized Patrick Henry as a modern pianist. In this painting, he was just like other figures on these kind of artworks, with unrealistic facial details and mistery emotion. However, the AI gave a specific answer to a rather common face. It seems the machine have categorized massive numbers of facial details that could help it distinguish the difference of a single cell. Yet, its jugdement is not precise at all. Even people can not totally recognize a face by one scan. If the biased result from digital recognition preoccupies human's mind, it could somehow mislead the true judgement.
