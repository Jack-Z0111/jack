			<p>I was surprised by Bush's vision of the digital future when the internet was not even a concept. He foresaw that the connections and communications of a community would highly rely on technology, and the developing construction of the internet community. Indeed, we define development as huge leaps from the present. Bush's view still helps with expectations of the next generation of digital networking, as we may also see how it goes in the far future.</p>

			<p>Bush might believe that internet comes after a manual building process, whereas Berners-Lee think that can be a concrete ecosystem which people may preserve. I agree with both side. On one hand, people set up the virtual environment and all functions. On the other hand, internet flows work like the ocean tide to some degree. People read articles, watch videos and get attracted by moments. Collaborations are done through internet tools, just as what people do in real life.</p>
			<p>What gets contrary to Berners-Lee's opinion is the disconnection between people and people, mind and flow. People stay anonymous online, which means they show anything that may not match to real ones. It is like playing a role to join in the online community. Plus, because of the anonymity, we technically feel free to say anything. This does not result in chaos but happens to lead the charge. Internet users follow words, follow whatâ€™s hot. I think the lifestyle end up to turn people into the role of users, and that preservation changes to security.</p>
