		<h1>Reflection</h1>
		<h2>by Jack Zhang</h2>
		
		<p>The appreciation of visual art is developing over times, and the Way of Seeing gives a glance on how people follow the tide in different eras. Before the revolution, real artworks can only be seen in galleries. When camera started to appear in normal life, people found ways to record up the art which would probably disappear on day. At this point, I think some kind of voice started to grow. Cameras, photographs added a value other than appreciation on the visual artwork, that people may need to preserve that precious thing. The way of seeing becomes the way of observing and keeping. While I walk in galleries and see flashlight and lens towards painting, I consider these visitors may not put their full selves into seeing the beauty, which I think is the loss of way of seeing.</p>
		<p>What I have been expected is the vision of game art in the future. As on pc and console nowadays, games are created with breathtaking visual elements. They have wild field, precious figures and some fantastic effect that we never see in real life. Whatâ€™s more, game make every visitor be able to interact with the art part. For role-playing games, players act as the virtual figure inside the screen, doing motions by their will. Compare to movies, I think game must be more developed in the way of seeing arts.</p>
